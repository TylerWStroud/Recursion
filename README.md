# Recursive Algorithms

This is a demonstration project for the recursive approach in computation. Both programs were designed to implement a simple yet practical recursive algorithm for the respective task. 
The algorithms are equipped with checkpoints to ensure the user has entered the necessary data before proceeding with their computations.

### AverageGrades.java
On run: User is prompted to enter a class size (option 1) and grades per student (option 2), then the class average is calculated (option 3).

### Vowels.java
On run: User is prompted to enter a string or phrase (option 1), then the number of vowels is calculated (option 2).
